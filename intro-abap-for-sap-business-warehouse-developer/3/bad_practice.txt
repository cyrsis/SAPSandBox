* PSEUDO CODE - Logic to be implemented

*  1. Derive month from the sales date, for example 20130105 means January

*  2. Get the booktype from the book master based on the bookcode

*  3. Define the discountpercent
*    a. IF Month = January AND booktype = Children THEN discountpercent is 30.
*    b. IF Month = September AND booktype = Travel THEN discountpercent is 15.
*    c. IF Month = July AND booktype = Webdesign THEN discountpercent is 5.

*  4. Define discount: discount = salesamount * discountpercent / 100.

    result = source_fields-amount * dp / 100.
