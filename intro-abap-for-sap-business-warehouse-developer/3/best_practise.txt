    DATA booktype             TYPE /bic/oizbooktype.
    DATA month_of_sale        TYPE /bi0/oicalmonth2.
    DATA discount_percentage  TYPE /bic/oikdiscperc.
    DATA sales_amount         TYPE /bi0/oiamount.

* PSEUDO CODE - Logic to be implemented

*  1. Derive month from the sales date, for example 20130105 means January

*  2. Get the booktype from the book master based on the bookcode

*  3. Define the discountpercent
*    a. IF Month = January AND booktype = Children THEN discountpercent is 30.
*    b. IF Month = September AND booktype = Travel THEN discountpercent is 15.
*    c. IF Month = July AND booktype = Webdesign THEN discountpercent is 5.

*  4. Define discount: discount = salesamount * discountpercent / 100.

    sales_amount = source_fields-amount.

    result = sales_amount * discount_percentage / 100.
