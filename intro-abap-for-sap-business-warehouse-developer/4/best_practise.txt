* PSEUDO CODE - Logic to be implemented

*  1. Derive month from the sales date, for example 20130105 means January

    sales_date = source_fields-calday.

    month_of_sale = sales_date+4(2).

*  2. Get the booktype from the book master based on the bookcode

    book_code = source_fields-/bic/zbook.

    SELECT SINGLE /bic/zbooktype
      INTO booktype
      FROM  /bic/mzbook
      WHERE  /bic/zbook  = book_code
      AND    objvers     = active.

*  3. Define the discountpercent
*    a. IF Month = January AND booktype = Children THEN discountpercent is 30.
*    b. IF Month = September AND booktype = Travel THEN discountpercent is 15.
*    c. IF Month = July AND booktype = Webdesign THEN discountpercent is 5.

    IF month_of_sale = january AND booktype = children.
      discount_percentage = 30.
    ENDIF.

    IF month_of_sale = september AND booktype = travel.
      discount_percentage = 15.
    ENDIF.

    IF month_of_sale = july AND booktype = webdesign.
      discount_percentage = 5.
    ENDIF.

*  4. Define discount: discount = salesamount * discountpercent / 100.

    sales_amount = source_fields-amount.

    result = sales_amount * discount_percentage / 100.
