    DATA bt(2)  TYPE c.
    DATA ms(2)  TYPE c.
    DATA dp	TYPE i.

* PSEUDO CODE - Logic to be implemented

*  1. Derive month from the sales date, for example 20130105 means January

    ms = source_fields-calday+4(2).

*  2. Get the booktype from the book master based on the bookcode

    SELECT SINGLE /bic/zbooktype
      INTO bt
      FROM  /bic/mzbook
      WHERE  /bic/zbook  = source_fields-/bic/zbook
      AND    objvers     = 'A'.

*  3. Define the discountpercent
*    a. IF Month = January AND booktype = Children THEN discountpercent is 30.
*    b. IF Month = September AND booktype = Travel THEN discountpercent is 15.
*    c. IF Month = July AND booktype = Webdesign THEN discountpercent is 5.

    IF ms = '01' AND bt = 'CH'.
      dp = 30.
    ENDIF.

    IF ms = '09' AND bt = 'TR'.
      dp = 15.
    ENDIF.

    IF ms = '07' AND bt = 'WD'.
      dp = 5.
    ENDIF.

*  4. Define discount: discount = salesamount * discountpercent / 100.

    result = source_fields-amount * dp / 100.
